Overall Rough Draft Score: 50 / 50
 
Basic Functionality (15 points):

* [ 9 / 10 ] Robot can move, and code runs without errors in simulator
    * cross throws an error
* [ 5 / 5 ] Robot does not crash into walls

Control Flow - If/Elif/Else (15 points):

* [ 4 / 5 ] At least one if/elif/else chain with 3+ branches
    * add in an `else` somewhere
* [ 5 / 5 ] At least one if/else that checks a sonar sensor reading
* [ 5 / 5 ] At least one if/else that checks user input

User Input (15 points):

* [ 3 / 3 ] At least 3 different input() prompts
* [ 6 / 6 ] At least 6 different user responses are handled (2 per prompt above)
* [ 6 / 6 ] Robot behavior changes based on user input at least 6 times (each response above corresponds to a different behavior)

Functions (10 points):

* [ 3 / 3 ] Define at least 3 functions
* [ 3 / 3 ] Call each of your functions at least once
* [ 0 / 3 ] For each function, include a doc string explaining the API
* [ 0 / 1 ] At least 1 of your functions has at least 1 parameter

Sensors (10 points):

* [ 5 / 5 ] Read a sonar distance at least 5 times
* [ 5 / 5 ] Robot behavior changes based on the sonar values

Loops/Recursion (15 points):

* [ 10 / 10 ] Implements indefinite execusing using at least one while loop OR at least one recursive function call
* [ 5 / 5 ] There is an option to terminate your indefinite execution

Here's your partner's feedback, which was actually even more useful than mine!

Basic Functionality (15 points):
Robot can move, and code runs without errors in simulator
Cross crashes
Robot does not crash into walls
Double zigzag crashes it. 
Control Flow - If/Elif/Else (15 points):
At least one if/elif/else chain with 3+ branches
At least one if/else that checks a sonar sensor reading
Unsure if this is a “final” addition to the code or not
At least one if/else that checks user input
User Input (15 points):
There is an input prompt
There are at least two possible user responses to that prompt that are handled differently
Robot behavior changes based on which of those responses the user gave.
There is ANOTHER input prompt
There are at least two possible user responses to THAT prompt that are handled differently
Robot behavior changes based on which of THOSE responses the user gave.
There is ANOTHER input prompt
There are at least two possible user responses to THAT prompt that are handled differently
Robot behavior changes based on which of THOSE responses the user gave.
The robot doesn't change but something else does
Functions (10 points):
A function is defined
That function is called at least once
That function has a doc string explaining what it does
ANOTHER function is defined
THAT function is called at least once
THAT function has a doc string explaining what it does
ANOTHER function is defined
THAT function is called at least once
THAT function has a doc string explaining what it does
Sensors (10 points):
Read a sonar distance
Robot behavior changes based on the sonar values from that reading
Read ANOTHER sonar distance
Robot behavior changes based on the sonar values from THAT reading
Hard to tell if the behavior changes because it crashes 
Read ANOTHER sonar distance
Robot behavior changes based on the sonar values from THAT reading
Hard to tell if the behavior changes because it crashes 
Read ANOTHER sonar distance
Robot behavior changes based on the sonar values from THAT reading
Hard to tell if the behavior changes because it crashes 
Read ANOTHER sonar distance
Robot behavior changes based on the sonar values from THAT reading
Hard to tell if the behavior changes because it crashes 
Loops/Recursion (15 points):
Implements indefinite execution using at least one while loop OR at least one recursive function call
There is an option to terminate your indefinite execution
I do not think this is given as a clear option though
